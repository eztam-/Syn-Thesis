## Syn-Thesis
Syn-Thesis is an additive VST synthesizer that is based on four independent oscillators. The waveform of each oscillator is generated by adding up to 64 harmonic frequencies. Syn-Thesis is one of the very few Java based VST synthesizers and is based on the jVSTwRapper. The plugin can be used in any VST 2 compatible DAW.
I have implemented this project as a part of my bachelor thesis in the year 2011.
